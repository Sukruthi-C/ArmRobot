# Intelligent Robotic Manipulation: Vision-Guided Precision in Automated Systems
This project focuses on advancing the autonomy of robotic systems through the integration of enhanced computer vision and precise kinematic control. Leveraging the power of an RGB-D camera paired with the ROS 2 ecosystem, we developed a system capable of sophisticated block manipulation tasks. The project encompasses the calibration of vision sensors to achieve high-fidelity depth perception, formulation of forward and inverse kinematic models for accurate trajectory planning, and the implementation of autonomous task execution algorithms. The robotic arm successfully demonstrated stacking, alignment, and color-based segregation with a high degree of precision. Challenges such as optimizing vision-based algorithms and hardware-software synergy were addressed, enhancing the robot's operational effectiveness. Future enhancements aim to refine path planning algorithms and expand the kinematic model's capabilities, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what autonomous robotic systems can achieve in dynamic environments.
